THIS   TIME   WILL   ALSO  PASS   BY.


A LINE SAID BY LORD KRISHNA TO ARJUNA.

YOUR  WORST DAY AND TIME OF YOUR LIFE WILL ALSO PASS BY.        SO DONT BE HUNG UP , OVER IT.

YOUR BEST DAY AND ALL AMAZING MOMENTS WILL ALSO PASS BY.        SO DONT BE ARROGANT ON WHAT YOU HAVE .



WE CAME TO THIS WORLD EMPTY HANDED AND WILL LEAVE EMPTY HANDED .    ( SO DONT BE TOO ATTACHED TO ANYTHING )

                                                  BHAGVAT GITA.

THANK YOU ,   
HAVE A NICE DAY.
